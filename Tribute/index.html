        Isaac Newton was born at Woolsthorpe near Grantham in Lincolnshire,
        England on 4 January 1643. His father died before he was born and in
        1645 his mother married a clergyman from North Welham in Leicestershire.
        She went to live with him while Isaac Newton lived with his grandmother.
        His mother returned to Woolsthorpe in 1656 when her second husband died
        and Isaac Newton went to live with her again.<br /><br />

        From the age of 12 to 14, Isaac Newton went to Grantham Grammar School.
        During this time he lodged with an apothecaryand his family. Then in
        1659, Isaac had to leave to help his mother on the family farm. Isaac
        was not in the slightestbit interested in running a farm and in 1660 he
        went to grammar school again.<br><br>

        In 1661 he went to Trinity College Cambridge. Isaac Newton obtained a BA
        in 1665. In 1666 Isaac Newton was forced toflee Cambridge because of an
        outbreak of the plague and he returned temporarily to Woolsthorpe. He
        returned touniversity in 1667.<br><br>

        In 1667 Isaac Newton was elected a fellow of Trinity College. The same
        year he was elected a member of the RoyalSociety. In February 1672 a
        paper he wrote about light and colours was read to the society. In 1669
        Isaac Newton becamea Lucasian professor of mathematics. In the meantime,
        in 1668, he invented a reflecting telescope.<br><br>

        In 1689-1690 Isaac Newton was MP for Cambridge University (in those days
        Cambridge University had its own MPs). Hebecame an MP again in 1701-1702
        but he did not take an active part in politics.<br><br>

        Isaac Newton published his masterpiece Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
        Mathematica in 1687. It set out his theory of gravity and his laws of
        motion.<br><br>

        In 1695 Isaac Newton was made Ward of the mint and in 1699 Master of the
        mint. He resigned his fellowship and professorship atCambridge in
        1701.<br /><br>

        In 1703 Isaac Newton became president of the Royal Society. He was
        knighted in 1705. Meanwhile, in 1704 Isaac Newton published another
        great work about light.
